        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The first step is to season and cook the meat until tender (with salt, seasoning cubes, curry & thyme, and sliced onions)</li>
            <li>Extract the stock and keep it for later use(Water extracted from the meat)</li>
            <li>Blend the tomatoes, Redball pepper(tatashe), Scotch bonnet pepper (Atarodo), garlic cloves, and onions.</li>
            <li>Turn the blended ingredients in a pot bring them to a boil until the water is completely dry.</li>
            <li>In another cooking pot add the vegetable oil, add sliced onion and allow it to saute for about 2 minutes, then go ahead to add the tomato paste and fry for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the boiled blended pepper, stir vigorously.</li>
            <li>Now start adding the seasonings: Curry, thyme, seasoning cubes/powder, salt and the chicken or meat stock earlier extracted. You may add more water 2- 3 cups of water that would be enough to cook the rice. (Do not add too much water as we donâ€™t want soggy jollof rice) Cover and allow everything to get incorporated for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Go ahead and start adding the washed rice(Rice should be washed about 5-6 times or until the water is clear) Then stir the rice in the sauce very well, add bay leaves and butter/ Margarine. Cover with foil first before covering with the pot lid.</li>
            <li>Cook on low heat, the foil steams the rice and cooks it. Check after the first 30 minutes, taste and adjust the seasoning if the need be. Then cover again</li>
            <li>Check again after 15- 20 minutes to see if the jollof rice is well cooked. (The overall cooking time varies on the type of rice used.)</li>
            <li>Use your turning stick to stir the rice through the bottom and evenly.</li>
            <li>Then cover only with the lid again for about 4 minutes and this time increase the heat to the highest to allow the rice to burn a little bit to give that smoky effect.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and stir evenly again through the bottom. Your smoky party Jollof rice is ready to be served. Serve with beef turkey or chicken.</li>
